# Election Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit 

The purpose of the election audit was to create a Python code that would quickly analyize election results, running statistics, and determine the winner of the election, and print the code back to a user friendly format that can be shared.

### Code Example:

The code used for this analysis was testing our knowledge on importing csv files, defining list and dictionaries, and using the for loop to quickly run through data. The first example code is a picture of how we imported our csv file and defined our list and dictionaries. The second example code is a picture of the for loop.

## Election Audit Summary 

Using this code will speed up the process of determine the election results as there is minimual manul counting. This will allow less people on election day counting votes and will save the commission money. Futhermore, with some additional lines of code, we will be able to collection voter data from the people and can sell that data back to politians for future elections. Additionally, we can set up an API poll which will allow your to pull data from a database and there will not be any need for a csv file.
